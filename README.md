Purpose:
    MudEngine is a text-based command-line tool that serves as the foundation
    for a single-player exploration game. It allows users to navigate a 3D
    coordinate-based world, inspect rooms, and interact with game elements.
    It is designed for building and testing game logic and world layouts
    without graphical assets. Once the world is defined, users can explore
    rooms, check descriptions, and manage game data efficiently, making
    it easier to expand into a full 3D RPG in the future.
